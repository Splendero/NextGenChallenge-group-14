# Portfolio Dashboard Backend (Python / FastAPI)

Status: **Task 1 (Portfolio Metadata via CRM Integration)**, **Task 2 (Holdings)**, **Task 3 (Performance History)** and **Task 7 (Currency Display)** are complete. Other tasks are not started yet. The code is structured for Task 9 (caching) and Task 4 (auth) to slot in; see "Extending" below.

Working on this as a team? Read [TEAM-GUIDE.md](TEAM-GUIDE.md) first. It covers the pinned stack, who owns which files, coding conventions, and the decisions we need to agree on.

## Install and run

Requires Python 3.11+ and Node 24+ (for the supplied mock CRM). From the repo root:

```sh
# 1. Generate the sample performance history (dates end today; see Task 3 below)
node backend/fixtures/generate-history.mjs

# 2. Start the supplied mock CRM (port 4002)
node backend/mock-crm.mjs

# 3. In another terminal, set up and start the backend (port 3000)
cd backend/solution
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --port 3000 --reload
```

Try it: <http://localhost:3000/portfolios/P-9001> and <http://localhost:3000/portfolios/P-9001/performance-history?range=1M>. Interactive API docs: <http://localhost:3000/docs>.

Configuration comes from environment variables (or a `.env` file; see [.env.example](.env.example)):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CRM_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:4002` | Where the CRM lives |
| `CRM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `3` | Per-attempt timeout for a CRM call |
| `CRM_MAX_RETRIES` | `1` | Extra attempts for transient failures (0 disables) |
| `CRM_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` | `0.2` | Pause before a retry |
| `CRM_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECONDS` | `5` | Hard cap on total time spent on the CRM per request |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log verbosity |
| `HISTORY_FILE` | `backend/fixtures/performance-history.json` | Generated daily history (Task 3) |
| `SEED_FILE` | `backend/fixtures/seed.json` | Seed data; Task 3 reads its portfolio list |

## Run the tests

```sh
cd backend/solution
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest                    # everything; live mock-CRM tests auto-skip if the mock isn't running
pytest -m "not integration"   # offline only
pytest -m integration         # only the live tests (start node backend/mock-crm.mjs first)
```

| File | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/test_mapper.py` | The pure mapper against every fixture, plus number parsing, timestamps, currency, account selection. A meta-test fails if a fixture is added without an expectation. |
| `tests/test_crm_client.py` | Timeout, retry, and status-code classification (respx), plus **real sockets** proving the timeout is enforced and refused connections are handled. |
| `tests/test_portfolios_api.py` | HTTP layer: every status code and error body, request ids, id validation, no detail leaks on 500, health/readiness, OpenAPI. |
| `tests/test_end_to_end_fake_crm.py` | Full stack (route, real HTTP client, mapper) against the scenario fake CRM for every fixture and forced status. |
| `tests/test_integration_mock_crm.py` | Live against the supplied mock: all modes, call counts, and 10 requests in `auto` mode without a crash or hang. |
| `tests/test_holdings.py` | Holdings calculations without HTTP (P-9001 values, zero quantity, zero previous close, empty portfolio) and the endpoint (all 12 camelCase fields, JSON `null`, `[]`, 404). |
| `tests/test_history.py` | Task 3, with today pinned and made-up data (no generated file needed): every range's window, month-end and leap-year clamping, gaps, future dates, short history, range parsing, file loading, and the HTTP layer (400/404/503, empty portfolio, OpenAPI). |
| `tests/test_currency.py` | Task 7: currency parsing and rates, USD on all three endpoints (money fields converted, quantities and percentages not), native values when omitted, totals agreeing across endpoints, 400 on every endpoint, null money fields, USD and unconvertible CRM accounts. |

## `GET /portfolios/{id}`

Successful response (`200`):

```json
{
  "portfolioId": "P-9001",
  "clientId": "abc123",
  "label": "Taxable Brokerage",
  "currency": "CAD",
  "totalMarketValue": 48930.0,
  "dayChangeAmount": 30.0,
  "dayChangePercent": 0.0006134969325153375,
  "totalReturnSinceInception": 0.187,
  "asOf": "2026-10-03T16:00:00Z",
  "warnings": [],
  "exchangeRate": 1.0
}
```

Errors always use one shape, and `requestId` matches the `X-Request-ID` response header:

```json
{ "error": "crm_timeout", "message": "…", "requestId": "…", "details": { "timeoutSeconds": 3.0 } }
```

| Situation | Status | `error` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Id isn't 1-64 chars of letters, digits, `-`, `_` (the CRM is **not** called) | 400 | `invalid_portfolio_id` |
| CRM says 404, or its payload has no account with that `acct_ref` | 404 | `portfolio_not_found` |
| CRM returns invalid JSON or HTML, or lacks `client_record` / `client_id` / `acct_ref`, or has conflicting duplicate accounts | 502 | `crm_bad_response` |
| CRM returns 5xx/429 or refuses the connection (after one retry for 503 or a refused connection) | 503 + `Retry-After` | `crm_unavailable` |
| CRM is slower than `CRM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, or returns 504 | 504 | `crm_timeout` |
| Anything unexpected (no internals leaked) | 500 | `internal_error` |

## `GET /portfolios/{id}/holdings`

Returns every position in the portfolio as an array. Inputs (`quantity`, `costBasisPerShare`, `price`, `previousClosePrice`) come from `backend/fixtures/seed.json`; every other field is calculated on each request in `app/calculations/holdings.py`. This endpoint doesn't call the CRM.

Example (`P-9002`):

```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "NEW",
    "name": "New Security",
    "assetClass": "Equity",
    "quantity": 10.0,
    "costBasisPerShare": 40.0,
    "price": 50.0,
    "previousClosePrice": 0.0,
    "marketValue": 500.0,
    "weightPercent": 1.0,
    "unrealizedGainLoss": 100.0,
    "dayChangeAmount": 500.0,
    "dayChangePercent": null,
    "currency": "CAD",
    "exchangeRate": 1.0
  }
]
```

| Situation | Status | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Known portfolio | 200 | Array of holdings |
| Known portfolio with no holdings (`P-EMPTY`) | 200 | `[]` |
| Unknown id | 404 | `portfolio_not_found` |

**Holdings decisions:**

- **Zero previous close:** `dayChangePercent` is `null` when `previousClosePrice` is 0 (`NEW` in `P-9002`), because a percentage change from zero is undefined. We chose `null` over `0` so clients can tell "no valid percentage" apart from "price didn't move". `dayChangeAmount` is still calculated (500). Note that `GET /portfolios/P-9002` reports `0` here, because it passes the CRM's value through; the holdings figure is our own calculation.
- **Portfolio total:** `weightPercent` divides by the sum of this portfolio's holding market values at request time, not by the CRM's `totalMarketValue`. For the seed data they match (P-9001: 48,930). If the total is 0, every weight is 0.
- **Zero quantity:** needs no special case. `marketValue`, `weightPercent`, `unrealizedGainLoss` and `dayChangeAmount` are all 0 (`ZERO` in `P-9001`). `dayChangePercent` is still the price change (0.2), because it doesn't depend on quantity.
- **No rounding:** values are returned unrounded, so weights may not sum to exactly 1 and some values carry float noise (for example `-570.0000000000017`). We don't "correct" either.
- **Empty vs unknown:** a portfolio that exists with no holdings returns `[]`; only an id missing from the seed's portfolio list returns 404.

## Design decisions and assumptions

**Mapping (see `app/crm/mapper.py`):**

- **Account selection:** The CRM returns all of the client's accounts. We match `acct_ref` exactly (case-sensitive) and never assume position. We search both `client_record.accounts` and `client_record.relationships.accounts`. If both contain the same account with identical data, that's fine; conflicting duplicates return 502.
- **Required fields:** `client_id` and the account's `acct_ref` are required. Without them we can't say whose data this is, so we return 502 rather than guess. If an account lacks `acct_ref` and we can't find the target, we return 502, not 404, because the unidentified account might be the target.
- **Optional fields become `null` plus a warning.** Missing or invalid values never break the response or get silently replaced with a fake value. Each produces a readable entry in `warnings` (for example `"totalMarketValue missing from CRM"`). Fields are always present in the response; they're never omitted.
- **`0` is a real value**, distinct from missing. A `P-EMPTY`-style account returns zeros with no warnings.
- **Number handling:** Numeric strings (`"482350.12"`, `" 0.187 "`, `"1,248,930.50"`) are accepted. Booleans, `"N/A"`, NaN/Infinity, and objects are rejected and become `null` with a warning. Values are never rounded.
- **Legacy shapes:** A bare-number `curr_val` (instead of `{amt, ccy}`) is accepted as the amount.
- **Currency:** Codes are upper-cased and trimmed. If the code is missing or invalid, we default to **CAD** (the platform's base currency, per the requirements) and add a warning. Non-CAD currencies pass through unconverted; conversion is Task 7.
- **`asOf`:** Normalized to ISO 8601 UTC with a `Z` suffix (offsets are converted). A timestamp without a timezone is assumed to be UTC, with a warning. A missing or unparseable timestamp becomes `null` with a warning.
- **`P-9002` day-change percent:** The mock reports `dayChangePercent: 0` while `dayChangeAmount` is 500, because its previous value was zero. We **pass the CRM's value through unchanged** (we don't recompute data the CRM owns) and add a warning that the percentage isn't meaningful, so a UI can show "n/a".
- **Extra or unknown CRM fields** are ignored.

**Resilience (see `app/crm/client.py`):**

- **Timeout:** 3 s per attempt and 5 s total, so a request can never hang. The mock's 10-second timeout mode returns 504 in about 3 s.
- **Retries:** We retry once (after 200 ms), but only for 503 responses and refused connections. These are fast and usually transient: in the mock's `auto` pattern, a 503 on call 5 is followed by a successful call 6, so the caller gets a 200. We never retry a timeout, because that would double the wait. We don't retry other 5xx responses, because they're less likely to be transient. Note for Task 9: a retried request makes two CRM calls, which shows up in `/__stats`.
- **One shared `httpx.AsyncClient`** (connection pooling) is created at startup and closed at shutdown.
- **Status codes:** 502, 503 and 504 are kept separate so callers (and Task 9's stale fallback) can tell "the CRM is down" apart from "the CRM is slow" and "the CRM sent garbage".

**Operational extras:**

- **Request ids:** `X-Request-ID` is accepted from the caller if it's safe (1-128 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`), otherwise generated. It's returned on every response, included in every error body, forwarded to the CRM, and included in every log line.
- **Structured logs:** each CRM attempt is logged, for example `crm_call portfolio=P-9001 attempt=1 outcome=CrmTimeout status=- latency_ms=3001.2`.
- **Health checks:** `GET /health` is liveness. `GET /health/ready` also checks that the CRM is reachable, returning 503 `degraded` if not.
- **Consistent errors:** unknown routes (404), wrong methods (405), and validation errors also use the standard error shape.

## Extra mock data

The supplied mock only has six modes, so `tests/fixtures/crm/` holds **27 extra CRM payloads**:

| Category | Fixtures |
| --- | --- |
| Valid | `ok_p9001`, `ok_target_not_first`, `zero_values`, `negative_day_change`, `usd_account`, `large_values`, `extra_unknown_fields`, `day_change_pct_zero_with_amount` |
| Inconsistent nesting | `nested_relationships`, `accounts_in_both_locations`, `curr_val_flat_number`, `chg_1d_missing` |
| Missing or bad values | `missing_amount_and_nickname`, `all_numbers_null`, `numeric_strings`, `invalid_number_types`, `lowercase_ccy`, `missing_ccy`, `missing_meta`, `bad_timestamp`, `offset_timestamp` |
| Should fail | `empty_accounts` (404), `no_client_record`, `missing_client_id`, `missing_acct_ref`, `duplicate_acct_ref`, `html_error_page` (all 502) |

### Scenario fake CRM

`scripts/fake_crm.py` serves any fixture on the same route as the real mock, so you can demo each edge case by hand:

```sh
python scripts/fake_crm.py --port 4003
CRM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4003 uvicorn app.main:app --port 3000

curl -X POST localhost:4003/__control -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"scenario":"invalid_number_types"}'
curl localhost:3000/portfolios/P-9001          # every fixture targets P-9001
curl -X POST localhost:4003/__control -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"slow_ms":4000}'   # -> 504
curl -X POST localhost:4003/__control -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"status":503}'     # -> 503 after retry
```

It also supports `GET /__scenarios` and `GET /__stats`. [requests.http](requests.http) contains ready-made requests for both CRMs.

## `GET /portfolios/{id}/performance-history` (Task 3)

Daily total market value for the performance chart, oldest first. `range` is optional: `1D`, `1M`, `YTD`, `1Y`, or `All` (the default).

```sh
curl 'localhost:3000/portfolios/P-9001/performance-history?range=1D'
```

```json
[
  { "date": "2026-10-02", "marketValue": 48917.8, "currency": "CAD", "exchangeRate": 1.0 },
  { "date": "2026-10-03", "marketValue": 48930.0, "currency": "CAD", "exchangeRate": 1.0 }
]
```

The data comes from `backend/fixtures/performance-history.json`, which `node backend/fixtures/generate-history.mjs` creates with dates ending today (UTC). The file is git-ignored. `P-9001` has 401 days, `P-9002` and `P-SINGLE` have 60, and `P-EMPTY` has none.

| Situation | Status | `error` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Id isn't 1-64 chars of letters, digits, `-`, `_` | 400 | `invalid_portfolio_id` |
| `range` isn't exactly one of the five values (`details.allowed` lists them) | 400 | `invalid_range` |
| Id isn't a portfolio in `seed.json` | 404 | `portfolio_not_found` |
| History file is missing or unreadable (the log names the command that generates it) | 503 | `history_unavailable` |

**Decisions:**

- **Every range ends today** (the current UTC date, the same "today" the generator uses) and includes both ends. `1D` starts yesterday, so it returns 2 points: the data is daily, and one point can't draw a line. `1M` and `1Y` start on the same day one month or one year back, clamped to the end of shorter months (Mar 31 becomes Feb 28, or Feb 29 in a leap year; Feb 29 becomes Feb 28). `YTD` starts on January 1 of the current year. `All` has no start date.
- **The window is chosen by date, not by counting points**, so gaps in the data don't stretch it further back. One consequence: if the data skips days (weekends, for example), `1D` can return a single point.
- **Short history is returned as-is**, never padded: `P-9002` with `range=1Y` returns its 60 days.
- **`range` must match exactly**, including case. `all`, an empty `range=`, or `1W` returns 400 rather than falling back to `All`.
- **Checks run in order:** id format, then `range`, then whether the portfolio exists. A bad `range` on an unknown id is therefore a 400, not a 404.
- **404 versus empty:** the portfolio list in `seed.json` decides whether an id exists. A portfolio with no history (`P-EMPTY`) returns 200 with `[]`.
- **Snapshots dated after today are dropped**, and values are passed through unrounded.
- **A missing history file doesn't stop the server**, so `/portfolios/{id}` keeps working and only this endpoint returns 503. Once loaded, the file is cached for the life of the process, so **restart the backend after regenerating it** (for example the next day, so `1D` and `YTD` line up with the new date).
- **Until the shared seed loader (`app/data/seed.py`, see [TEAM-GUIDE.md](TEAM-GUIDE.md)) exists**, `app/services/history_service.py` reads both JSON files itself. Switching over only touches `get_history_service` in `app/dependencies.py`.

## Currency display: `?currency=CAD|USD` (Task 7)

`GET /portfolios/{id}`, `GET /portfolios/{id}/holdings` and `GET /portfolios/{id}/performance-history` accept an optional `currency` parameter. Every response (each item, for the two array endpoints) says which currency its money is in and which rate was applied:

```sh
curl 'localhost:3000/portfolios/P-9001/holdings?currency=USD'
```

```json
[
  { "ticker": "AAPL", "quantity": 120.0, "price": 166.075, "marketValue": 19929.0, "weightPercent": 0.5579, "currency": "USD", "exchangeRate": 0.73, "...": "..." }
]
```

| Situation | Status | `error` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `currency` isn't exactly `CAD` or `USD` (`details.allowed` lists them) | 400 | `unsupported_currency` |

**Decisions:**

- **What gets converted:** money only. That's `totalMarketValue` and `dayChangeAmount` on the portfolio; `costBasisPerShare`, `price`, `previousClosePrice`, `marketValue`, `unrealizedGainLoss` and `dayChangeAmount` on holdings; `marketValue` in history. Quantities and every percentage are unchanged.
- **Omitted means native:** no `currency` (or the portfolio's own currency) returns unconverted values with `exchangeRate: 1.0`.
- **The rate** is `CADtoUSD` from `seed.json` (0.73), read through `app/data/seed.py`. USD to CAD uses its inverse.
- **No rounding:** every money field is multiplied by the same rate, so converted holdings still add up to the converted portfolio total (`P-9001`: 48930 CAD is 35718.9 USD on both endpoints). Clients round for display.
- **Metadata on arrays:** `currency` and `exchangeRate` are added to each item, keeping the responses plain arrays as the requirements show.
- **Exact match**, like `range`: `usd` or an empty `currency=` returns 400 rather than falling back. The parameter is checked before anything else is looked up, so a bad currency never calls the CRM.
- **CRM accounts in another currency:** a USD account converts to CAD with the inverse rate. If the CRM reports a currency we have no rate for (say EUR), the values come back unconverted in that currency, with `exchangeRate: 1.0` and a warning, rather than failing the request.
- **Task 9 can cache native data:** `PortfolioService.get_metadata` still returns unconverted CRM data; conversion happens afterwards in `get_portfolio`.

## Extending

- **Task 9 (cache):** wrap `PortfolioService.get_metadata`. Cache the mapped `PortfolioMetadata` per id. On `CrmTimeout` or `CrmUnavailable` with an expired entry, serve it with `stale: true`. `CrmNotFound` and `CrmBadResponse` should probably not fall back to stale data; decide and document.
- **Task 4 (auth):** add a dependency or middleware before the routers. `/health` should probably stay public. The API tests in `tests/test_history.py` will then need the token header too.
## Unfinished / known limitations

- Only Tasks 1, 2, 3 and 7 are implemented.
- There's no authentication yet, so the endpoints are open (Task 4).
- There's no caching yet (Task 9): every request calls the CRM.
- Performance history is read once per process, so a regenerated file needs a restart.
- Only CAD and USD are supported, with one fixed rate from the seed data.
