# Swagger UI renders every newline as a line break, so each paragraph, bullet and table row is one line.
DESCRIPTION = """\
Backend for a wealth management portfolio dashboard. Portfolio metadata is read live from a legacy CRM and \
mapped into a clean schema, and daily performance history feeds the dashboard's line chart.

**Try it:** press **Authorize** and enter the mock token, `superday-demo-token` unless the server sets \
`API_TOKEN` (Swagger adds the `Bearer ` prefix). Every operation is already in "Try it out" mode: pick an example \
from a parameter's dropdown, then press **Execute**.

### Conventions
- Every endpoint except the health checks needs an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- JSON fields are camelCase. Money is in CAD unless a response says otherwise.
- Add `?currency=USD` to the portfolio, holdings or history endpoint to convert every money field. Each \
response says which `currency` and `exchangeRate` it used; quantities and percentages never change.
- Percentages are decimals: `0.0032` means 0.32%.
- Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. Timestamps are ISO 8601 in UTC and end in `Z`.
- Every response has an `X-Request-ID` header. Send your own (up to 128 letters, digits, `.`, `_` or `-`) to \
trace a request through our logs and the CRM.

### Errors
Every error body has `error` (a stable code), `message`, `requestId` (the same value as the `X-Request-ID` \
header) and sometimes `details`.

| Status | `error` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_portfolio_id`, `invalid_range`, `unsupported_currency` | Bad input. An invalid id or currency \
never reaches the CRM. |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | The `Authorization` header is missing, isn't `Bearer <token>`, or has the wrong token. |
| 404 | `portfolio_not_found` | No portfolio has this id. |
| 502 | `crm_bad_response` | The CRM sent data we can't interpret safely. |
| 503 | `crm_unavailable`, `history_unavailable` | The CRM is down (a `Retry-After` header says when to try \
again), or the history data file is missing. |
| 504 | `crm_timeout` | The CRM didn't answer in time. |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Something unexpected failed. No internal details are exposed. |

### When the CRM misbehaves
- Each CRM attempt times out after **{timeout:g} s**, and a request never spends more than **{budget:g} s** on \
the CRM in total, so nothing hangs.
- A CRM `503` or a refused connection {retries}. Timeouts aren't retried, because that would double the wait.
- Values the CRM leaves out or sends in an unusable form come back as `null`, with an explanation in \
`warnings`. A real `0` stays `0`.
